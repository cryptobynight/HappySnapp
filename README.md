# HappySnapp

[HappySnapp](https://happysnapp.netlify.app/) is an iOS app built with SwiftUI for iOS 14. I used a number of resources, including courses, blogs and Stack Overflow, to teach myself the language to build my vision of a simple app to make people happy. The whole point of the app was to provide a simple experience to block out the chaos of the world and put a smile on your face. Unfortunately, the AppStore insisted that more functionality be added which defeated the purpose of my initial vision - alas, it remains a shelved product but a great learning experience.
